		<h3>19. Applicable Law; Arbitration</h3>

		<p>
			This section applies to any dispute EXCEPT IT DOESN’T INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE OR EQUITABLE RELIEF REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR OR VIZIBID’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The term "dispute" means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Vizibid concerning the Websites, Services or the Terms, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance or any other legal or equitable basis. "Dispute" will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, neither you or Vizibid are required to resolve claims in accordance with this Section 19 with respect to disputes arising from a wet signature written agreement between you and Vizibid which was signed by an authorized signatory of each party (for purposes of this exception only, a "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreement shall not be construed as a written agreement).
		</p>

		<ul class="no-bullets">
			<li>
				<strong>A. Notice of Dispute.</strong> In the event of a dispute, you or Vizibid must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to: Vizibid at 2427 East Denny Way, Seattle, WA 98122 or to <a href="mailto:info@vizibid.com">info@vizibid.com</a>. Vizibid will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and Vizibid will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or Vizibid may commence arbitration.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>B. Small claims court.</strong> You may also litigate any dispute in small claims court in your county of residence or King County, Washington, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>C. Binding arbitration.</strong> If you and Vizibid do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. The dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The enforceability of this requirement to arbitrate shall be determined only by the arbitrator, and not by a judge or jury. The arbitration will be conducted in Seattle, Washington, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by Washington law. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party’s rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>D. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individual Actions.</strong> You and Vizibid agree that either may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as part of any purported class or representative action or proceeding unless both you and Vizibid agree otherwise. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding. Also the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other Vizibid users.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>E. Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary, you and Vizibid agree that if Vizibid makes any change to the Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change of any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim of which you provided Vizibid with written notice prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if Vizibid seeks to terminate the Agreement to Arbitrate as included in the Terms, any such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of the Agreement to Arbitrate is posted to <a href="http://vizibid.com">vizibid.com</a> and shall not be effective as to any claim of which you provided Vizibid with written notice prior to the date of termination.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>20. Miscellaneous Terms</h3>

		<p>
			The Terms are governed by and construed by the laws of the State of Washington, in the United States, exclusive of its choice of law rules. Either party’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of any of the Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If any term or part of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any final determination of a competent court, arbitrator, or tribunal, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The parties agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Vizibid as a result of the Terms, or your use of any of the Websites or Services. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Vizibid relating to this subject matter and supersede all prior, contemporaneous and future communications (with the exception of future amendments to the Terms as made available by Vizibid from time to time) between you and Vizibid. A printed version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial, arbitration or administrative proceedings based on or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generating and maintained in printed form. The Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Vizibid without restriction.
