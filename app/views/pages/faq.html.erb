		<h3>I received an access code to create an account. Can I share the code with other lawyers?</h3>
		<p>
			Yes. Feel free to share your access code with any lawyer you know. Vizibid's document library and community content will only improve with the number of great lawyers who join.
		</p>
		<h3>I do not have an access code, but I would like one. How do I get an access code?</h3>
		<p>
			To get an access code, request one in an email to <a href="mailto:info@vizibid.com">info@vizibid.com</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Where does Vizibid get the model documents in its library?</h3>
		<p>
			Primarily, Vizibid's document library is built up from the documents that lawyers like you share. Because of this, Vizibid's available documents will grow and improve as more and more lawyers join and participate. Vizibid also contributes documents of its own. Vizibid's contributions are documents that were donated to Vizibid by experienced lawyers. You can identify these donated documents because they are uploaded by a user named "Vizibid." 
		</p>
		<h3>I too would like to donate my entire collection of legal documents to Vizibid. Can I do that?</h3>
		<p>
			We would love to hear from you. Send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@vizibid.com">info@vizibid.com</a> and let us know.
		</p>
		<h3>I'm not a lawyer. Can I create an account?</h3>
		<p>
			Only lawyers can create an account on Vizibid. Lawyers with accounts will someday be able to create limited subordinate accounts for their non-lawyer employees.
