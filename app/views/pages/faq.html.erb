		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> I received an access code to create an account. Can I share the code with other lawyers?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> Yes. Feel free to share your access code with any lawyer you know. Vizibid's document library and community content will only improve with the number of great lawyers who join.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> I do not have an access code, but I would like one. How do I get an access code?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> To get an access code, request one in an email to <a href="mailto:info@vizibid.com">info@vizibid.com</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> I tried to sign up, but the sign-up form is just a bunch of blank text boxes. What do I do?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> The short answer is that you should upgrade your browser. (See the next question and answer for how to upgrade your browser.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Now for the long answer for those who are tech-curious: Vizibid's user experience design is built using the latest in web standards (currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank">HTML5</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">CSS3</a>). The latest standards are not fully supported in browsers that have not recently been updated. In older web browsers many modern websites will not look right, and interactive parts of modern web pages will often not operate as the designers intended. This means menus might not open when clicked, text may not be displayed, images may appear out of place or not at all, videos won't play, etc. The good news is that newer browsers are fully compatible with the latest web standards. (There is a helpful visualization of browser version capabilities at <a href="http://html5readiness.com/" target="_blank">html5readiness.com</a>.) Upgrading your web browser is free and could immensely improve your experience of the Internet. If nothing else, upgrading will probably improve your experience of Vizibid.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> How do I upgrade my browser?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> Visit the website for the browser you prefer to use and download the latest version for free. Here are links to four major browsers: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank">Internet Explorer</a>, and <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari" target="_blank">Safari</a>.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> Where does Vizibid get the model documents in its library?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> Primarily, Vizibid's document library is built up from the documents that lawyers like you share. Because of this, Vizibid's available documents will grow and improve as more and more lawyers join and participate. Vizibid also contributes documents of its own. Vizibid's contributions are documents that were donated to Vizibid by experienced lawyers. You can identify these donated documents because they are uploaded by a user named "Vizibid." 
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> I too would like to donate my entire collection of legal documents to Vizibid. Can I do that?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> We would love to hear from you. Send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@vizibid.com">info@vizibid.com</a> and let us know.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> Does Vizibid scan uploaded documents for computer viruses?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> Yes. All files that you and other lawyers upload to Vizibid are scanned using a third-party virus scanner, <a href="https://scanii.com/" target="_blank">Scanii</a> by Uva Software, LLC, before they are added to the community document library.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> When I connect to vizibid.com, my address bar shows "https" instead of "http." Why?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> Every time you connect to vizibid.com, you connect over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which is a communications protocol for secure communications over a computer network. Vizibid uses HTTPS to help secure the information you send and receive while using vizibid.com. To learn more about HTTPS, read the entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure" target="_blank"> HTTP Secure</a> on Wikipedia.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> I'm not a lawyer. Can I create a Vizibid account?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> Only lawyers can create an account on Vizibid. Lawyers with accounts will someday be able to create limited subordinate accounts for their non-lawyer employees.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> How do I contact Vizibid?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> For general inquiries, send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@vizibid.com">info@vizibid.com</a>.

		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> What does the word "Vizibid" mean?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> "Vizibid" is a made-up word, a combination of the abbreviations <em>viz.</em> and <em>ibid.</em>, which are sometimes seen in legal writing.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>Q:</strong> Who created Vizibid?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A:</strong> Vizibid was co-founded by software engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/MBeitchman" target="_blank">Marc Beitchman</a> and lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/forrest_carlson" target="_blank">Forrest Carlson</a>.
